<h1> 	Poetry is such a vibrant genre. One that’s capable of expressing multiple figures of speech, evoking diverse emotions, and 
	constantly pushing the barriers of impact and awareness. Poetry can be meaningful, rhythmic and it has a certain beauty to it.

	In the words of Victorian Poet, Matthew Arnold, ‘The Crown of Literature is indeed poetry’. The implication of this statement 
	posits that poetry is a royal institution that must be protected, preserved, and generational. However, if history is any 
	indication, it’s apparent that poetry hasn’t always been treated like the Crown of Literature.

	In the past, poetry was infused into speech, books, and way of life. At this time, there was a clear-cut structure that laid 
	the foundation of poetry and indeed it was prioritized. In medieval times, Kings and Queens were appraised through the colloquial 
	of poetry. Basking and relishing in the intricately woven yarns of adoration weft into lines and stanzas of diverse poems. 
	Lovers were seen expressing their deepest emotions via this verbal art. It was such a time to be alive.

	In this era, it’s safe to say that the crown has been left unprotected for way too long. Although still inspirational and 
	impactful, it’s apparent that the development of modern poetry had somewhat diffused the antiquated elegance of the genre.

	While it is used to reflect multiple events, emotions, and constructs, the use of modern-day poetry leans towards impacting 
	social justice and highlighting political flaws in diverse world countries. Thus, the genre has taken on a new narrative, one 
	fueled by change and resilience. This is commendable and so many poets bear the accolades for this movement. Knowledge, they say,
	is power and in an attempt to uplift and preserve the Crown, this piece is highlighting a handful of the best poems of all time. </h1>
